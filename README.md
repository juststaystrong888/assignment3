We would like to create a simple simulation of a car race around a race track. There is an average time, in seconds, that all cars take to complete a lap around the track. The total time each individual car takes to complete a single lap is affected by the attributes of the car and the conditions of the race track. During a race, we would like to know who the leader is at the end of each lap. At the end, we would like to know the winner.
